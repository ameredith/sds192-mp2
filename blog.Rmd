## Loading the data and Libraries 

```{r, include=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```
 - use house_elections data to find the relation between the number of votes given to republican vs. democratic candidates 
 
## Sorting the data
```{r}

Cand <- candidates %>%
  select(cand_id, cand_name, cand_party_affiliation, cand_election_yr)  %>%
  #filter(cand_party_affiliation == "DEM" ,cand_election_yr >= 2000, cand_election_yr <=2012) %>%
  arrange(cand_election_yr)

x <- rename(Cand,  fec_id = cand_id)

House <- select(house_elections, fec_id, incumbent)

joined <- x %>% inner_join(House,  by = "fec_id")
joined
```
- What are we graphing?

## Creating the graph
```{r}
ggplot(data = joined, aes(x = , y = )) + geom_line()
```

## Summarize the results
```{r}

```
